# UX-Vision Forensic Node v8.0: Swarm Commander

## Forensic Intelligence via Synthetic Population Simulation

This node executes high-fidelity audits by spawning a **Synthetic Swarm** of 50 specialized agents. Every research conclusion is a statistical consensus derived from behavior-driven telemetry.

### 1. Swarm Composition (50 Personas)
- **30% Power Users**: Efficiency-focused, keyboard-first, low error tolerance.
- **40% Casual/Standard Users**: Path-focused, high reliance on visual affordance.
- **20% Aging/Low-Vision**: Contrast-critical, high gaze-latency.
- **10% Motor-Impaired**: Target-size sensitive, high "Fitts's Law" movement costs.

### 2. Behavioral Metrics
The Swarm calculates:
- **Time-to-Task (ms)**: Predicted latency based on cognitive load and movement travel.
- **Error Probability**: Statistical likelihood of mis-clicks or interaction dead-ends.
- **Success Rate**: Binary outcome across the population for a specific primary goal.

### 3. A/B Variant Simulation
The engine evaluates the delta between **Variant A (Control)** and **Variant B (Optimized)**. By simulating 50 users on both, we project the **Expected Lift** in success rates.

### 4. Technical Stack
- **Engine**: Gemini 3 Pro (Vision-Reasoning Architecture)
- **Budget**: 20,000 reasoning tokens per Swarm execution.
- **Coordinate Grounding**: Absolute anchoring to a 1000x1000 pixel matrix.
